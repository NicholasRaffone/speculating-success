# Speculating Success: An Experimental Study on Improving Neural Network Efficiency

This is a paper I wrote between July 2019 and June 2020 as part of the AP Research Program.

The paper focuses on improving the accuracy of neural networks aimed at predicting student performance.
By implementing dropout and adaptive optimisation, the paper finds a 70% accuracy in its predictions.

The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance).
